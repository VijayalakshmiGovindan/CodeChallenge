**Proposed Test Design for Access Control**

Objective: Minimize unauthorized access to entities in the software system.
Testing Approach:
This design will utilize a combination of  test cases to verify access control functionality for different user roles and address the  obvious omissions and uncovered areas that contribute to remaining risk

Test Cases:
1. Admin User:
    * Positive Tests:
        * Create, read, update, and delete User Accounts (all roles).
        * Create, read, update, and delete Brands.
        * Create, read, update, and delete Product Lists.
        * Grant different permissions (Admin, Brand Admin, User) to User Accounts.
    * Negative Tests:
        * Attempt to create a new Admin User account (should not be allowed).
        * Attempt to delete the existing Admin User account (should not be allowed).
2. Brand Admin User:
    * Positive Tests:
        * Create, read, update, and delete Product Lists within their assigned Brand.
        * Read information about their assigned Brand.
        * Update information about their assigned Brand (excluding ownership).
    * Negative Tests:
        * Create, read, update, and delete User Accounts.
        * Create, read, update, and delete Brands (apart from their assigned one).
        * Update ownership of their assigned Brand.
3. User:
    * Positive Tests:
        * Read information about all Brands and Products.
        * Read information about their own User Account.
    * Negative Tests:
        * Create, update, and delete any entities (User Accounts, Brands, Product Lists).
        * Grant permissions to User Accounts.


Obvious omissions and uncovered areas  :

1. Unforeseen User Interactions:
   The test cases focus on individual actions (create, read, update, delete) for each entity. However, real-world usage might involve combinations of actions that could potentially bypass intended access restrictions. Consider testing scenarios where users perform a sequence of actions to achieve unauthorized access.
2. Edge Cases and Error Handling:
 The design mentions testing error handling for unauthorized access attempts. However, it's important to dive deeper and explore edge cases like:
    * Concurrent access attempts by multiple users.
    * Accessing recently deleted entities.
    * Manipulating data to gain unauthorized access (e.g., modifying user role data).
3. Mocking and Dependency Injection:
  The design doesn't explicitly mention mocking external dependencies or using dependency injection for testing. These techniques can help isolate the access control logic and test its behaviour in controlled environments.
4. Security Vulnerabilities:
   The focus is on functional testing of access control. However, it's crucial to consider security vulnerabilities that could be exploited to bypass access restrictions. This might involve penetration testing or security-focused code reviews, security and performance testing.
5. User Interface (UI) Testing:
  While the design focuses on backend functionalities, it's vital to include UI testing to ensure the user interface accurately reflects the intended access control behaviour. This includes testing scenarios where users might attempt to access unauthorized functionalities through the UI.Automating the test cases whenever possible for efficient and repeatable execution will help immensely.

Remaining Risk:
By addressing these omissions, the remaining risk associated with unauthorized access can be significantly reduced if not completely.Continuous monitoring and improvement of the security posture is crucial.
